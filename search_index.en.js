To be precise, we set wˆi = wi/c, where wi are the weights and c is the per-layer normalization constant from He’s initializer (He et al., 2015). The benefit of doing this dynamically instead of during initialization is somewhat subtle, and relates to the scale-invariance in commonly used adaptive stochastic gradient descent methods such as RMSProp (Tieleman &amp; Hinton, 2012) and Adam (Kingma &amp; Ba, 2015). These methods normalize a gradient update by its estimated standard deviation, thus making the update independent of the scale of the parameter. As a result, if some parameters have a larger dynamic range than others, they will take longer to adjust. This is a scenario modern initializers cause, and thus it is possible that a learning rate is both too large and too small at the same time. Our approach ensures that the dynamic range, and thus the learning speed, is the same for all weights. A similar reasoning was independently used by van Laarhoven (2017).\n\nModern optimizers such as the Deep Learning/Adam optimzer limit gradient update step sizes. However, in GANs, different parameters have vastly different dynamic ranges (i.e. the range of values). In order to equalize the learning rate between different parameters, we divide the parameters by its fan-in (i.e. estimated standard deviation) during runtime.\nUpdate rule\nWe set the quantities $\\hat{m_t}$ and  $\\hat{v_t}$ as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\hat{m_t} &amp;= \\frac{\\hat{m_t}}{1-\\beta_1^t} \\\\\\hat{v_t} &amp;= \\frac{\\hat{v_t}}{1-\\beta_2^t}\n\\end{align}\n$$\nsuch that:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nE[\\hat{m_t}] &amp;= E[g_t] \\\\E[\\hat{v_t}] &amp;= E[g_t^2]\n\\end{align}\n$$\nSo the gradient update rule becomes:\n$$\nw_t = w_{t-1} - \\eta \\frac{\\hat{m_t}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{v_t}} + \\epsilon}\n$$\nReference video\nNote that StyleGAN2 code ignored the root 2 factor in their scaling factor because it was cancelled with the subsequent summing with bias term.

So the usage of bottleneck designs is mainly due to practical considerations. We further note that the degradation problem of plain nets is also witnessed for the bottleneck designs.\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05027.pdf\nAs indicated by the grey arrows in Fig. 2, the shortcut connections are the most direct paths for the information to propagate. Multiplicative manipulations (scaling, gating, 1×1 convolutions, and dropout) on the shortcuts can hamper information propagation and lead to optimization problems.\nIn fact, the shortcut-only gating and 1×1 convolution cover the solution space of identity shortcuts (i.e., they could be optimized as identity shortcuts). However, their training error is higher than that of identity shortcuts, indicating that the degradation of these models is caused by optimization issues, instead of representational abilities.\nThe distinction between post-activation/pre-activation is caused by the presence of the element-wise addition. For a plain network that has N layers, there are N − 1 activations (BN/ReLU), and it does not matter whether we think of them as post- or pre-activations.

The dreaded ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package has haunted me for years. And now, I have decided to figure things out once and for all. (No more fear of running a Python script not in the project root directory yay!)\nDo we still need __init__.py?\n\nThe Zen of Python: Explicit is better than implicit.\n\nSince Python 3.3 (please leave if you use anything older than that, you are not welcomed), __ini__.py is not longer a must for the Python import system. But what exactly happens with / without __init__.py? (reference)\nWhen to include __init__.py?\n\nInclude __init__.py when you don't want to open up your namespace to third party contributions (e.g. all standard library packages).\n\nWithout __init__.py, multiple directories can contribute to the same package. With __init__.py, a single directory package is created (masking preceding, matching subdirectories on sys.path without __init__.py).\nConsider the following directory layout:\nproject/\n    example/\n        foo.py\nproject2/\n    example/\n        __init__.py\n        bar.py\n\nWe can see the expected results:\n$ PYTHONPATH=../project2 python3 -c \"import example.bar\"\nHello from  example.bar\n$ PYTHONPATH=../project2 python3 -c \"import example.foo\"\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;string&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nImportError: No module named 'example.foo'\n\n$ rm ../project2/example/__init__.py\n$ PYTHONPATH=../project2 python3 -c \"import example.bar\"\nHello from  example.bar\n$ PYTHONPATH=../project2 python3 -c \"import example.foo\"\nHello from  example.foo\n\nWith -m or without m?\nI can't even count how many times I used to do python sub_dir/script.py and get ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package...\nWhat does the -m do?\nWhen you run python sub_dir/script.py, the file is run as a script, meaning that the file's parent directory is added to sys.path at index 0. As such, relative imports inside sub_dir/script.py like from ..xxx import yyy do not work as the parent directory of sub_dir is not inside sys.path (imagine the rabit hole that is opened if Python searches through every parent directory of script.py for packages hmmm).\n\nIf this option is given, the first element of sys.argv will be the full path to the module file. As with the -c option, the current directory will be added to the start of sys.path. (see)\n\nIf we run python -m sub_dir/script, the sys.path behaviour is described above. The Python interpreter will then \"search sys.path for the named module and execute its contents as the __main__ module\". Thus, the relative imports work as expected.\nWhy is -m not the default behaviour?\nThe content above would probably leave a lot of you (including me) wondering why -m is not the default behaviour since often times we actually want to execute a script as a module. To answer that, I would quote Martijn Pieters's answer here.\n\nScripts can be opened in any arbitrary path and then their parent directory is added to the module search path. -m only works for the current directory or directories already registered on the search path. That was my point. -m is not something you give to end-users for that very usability issue.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/programming/python/python-imports/","title":"Python Imports"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/programming/python/python-regex/":{"body":"RegEx Methods\n\nmatch(pattern: str, string: str) -&gt; Match | None: look for first match at beginning of string\nsearch(pattern: str, string: str) -&gt; Match | None: scan through a string for first match\nfindall(pattern: str, string: str) -&gt; List[str | Tuple[str, ...]]: find all matches, returning entire match / tuple of subgroup matches\n\nMatch Object\n\nMatch.group(group1: int, ...) -&gt; None | str | Tuple[str, ...]: 0 is entire match, 1 onwards is parenthsized subgroup\n\nIf group is inside unmatched part, return None\nIf group is matched multiple times, return last match\n\n\nMatch.groups() -&gt; Tuple[str, ...]: returns all subgroups, entire match is not included\n\n","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/programming/python/python-regex/","title":"Python RegEx"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/programming/python/python-strings/":{"body":"Reference\nEUREKA Moment\nMany people scratches their head when trying to comprehend string encodings because they cannot separate between the following:\nHuman-readable CharacterComputer MemoryProgramming Language\nä\\xc3a4c280c280\"\\u00e4\\u0080\\u0080\"\n\nHuman-readable Characters\nThe characters that you see on screen. These are displayed to you by the GPU using individual pixels in the screen.\nComputer Memory\nThe character, when stored on the computer (e.g. if you save a file with the ä character inside it), gets saved in bytes according to the chosen encoding. Most text editors use UTF-8.\nNote: above example uses UTF-8 and Big Endian\nProgramming Language\nYour specific programming language would have a syntax for specifying Unicode strings. In Python 3, all strings are unicode by default (so '\\u0041' and u'\\u0041' are exactly the same). It is however important to distinguish how characters are stored in the file versus in runtime and compile-time.\nFor example, imagine you have following Python script (simple.py):\nv = \"\\u00e4\\u0080\\u0080\"\n\nThen, simple.py will be stored in the filesystem using the UTF-8 encoding. The characters \"\", \"u\", \"0\", \"0\", \"e\", \"4\", ... will be stored as-in (i.e. 0x5c75303065345c75303038305c7530303830). If you run file simple.py, it tells you that the document is ASCII text because the \"\\u\" syntax is only used and interpreted during the Python run time.\nHowever, during runtime, the hex value of v is set to 0xc3a4c280c280 because the python interpreter reads the string \"\\u0041\" and turns it into UTF-8 bytes. But actually, you can also just do v = \"ä\".\nAlso, note that some programming languages store strings as UTF-16 by default, e.g. Java.\nUnicode Converter\nUnicode\nASCII\n\nEnglish letters, digits and symbols stored as number between 32 and 127\n8-bit was more than enough to store these characters\n\nUnicode\n\nRepresents every possible symbol and language\nEach character is called a code point like U+0000 to U+10FFFF (reference)\n\nUTF-8\n\nOne possible way to store unicode characters in bytes\nEach code point is stored using at least 1 byte and code points 0-127 (i.e. ASCII characters) store as-in. Hence backwards-compatible with ASCII\nWhen a byte starts with 1 (i.e., above 127), special treatment is done (reference)\nControl characters (e.g. newline, language specifiers etc.) which are not naturally displayed also exist\n\nUTF-16 and UTF-32\n\nMinimum byte size differs\n\nPython Strings\nAs mentioned above, Python 3 strings are unicode by default so the backslash \\ has special meanings to signify special characters (e.g. \\s, \\x, \\u, \\n, \\t, etc.). To store a backslash in a strin variable, you need to repeat every backslash (i.e. v = \"\\\\\\\\\" stores 0x5c5c to v).\nRaw String\nTo avoid treating the backslash chracter specially and avoid going down the backslash rabbit hole, you can use raw strings v = r\"\\s\" will store 0x5c73 to v instead of 0x20. This is especially useful in RegEx expressions.\nByte String / Literal\nYou might also have seen the syntax b'\\x41' or b'\\u0041'. These are byte literals which represents a byte array using strings according to the PEP standard syntax. The return value is of type byte instead of str.\nThe Terminal\nHave you also ever wondered how does Python know what encoding to use when printing strings to the terminal? As we all know, the Linux kernel only allows new processes to be created by spawning or forking from an existing process.

BUT, most Docker containers have packages installed as root user. What can we do?\n\nMy Issue At the Time\nGoal: \nDocker Pytorch environment with working nvcc and nvprof\nIssues:\n\nnvcc and nvprof versions need to match exactly (which is not true for CUDA 11.3 and 11.4, not matter whether you installed it using NVIDIA's CUDA images or conda's cudatoolkit-dev)\nPytorch only supports up to CUDA 11.3 (else you need to build it from source but no thanks mate)\nnvcc and nvprof version needs to support my WSL's CUDA driver version (11.5) (not too sure if this is 100% necessary)\nNVIDIA's nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.12-py3 has pytorch installed in the root's conda, but I want to run the container as non-root and be able to install additional packages\n\nSolution:\nClone conda environment. My Dockerfile is as follows:\nFROM nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:21.12-py3\n\nARG USERNAME=user\nARG USER_UID=1000\nARG USER_GID=$USER_UID\n\n# Change shell\nSHELL [\"/bin/bash\", \"-c\"]\n\n# Add User\nRUN groupadd --gid $USER_GID $USERNAME \\\n\t&amp;&amp; useradd --uid $USER_UID --gid $USER_GID -m $USERNAME \\\n\t&amp;&amp; apt-get update -y \\\n\t&amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade -y \\\n\t&amp;&amp; apt-get install -y sudo git wget curl htop build-essential ninja-build \\\n\t&amp;&amp; echo $USERNAME ALL=\\(root\\) NOPASSWD:ALL &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME \\\n\t&amp;&amp; chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/$USERNAME\n\n# Install conda packages for VSCode\nRUN conda install -y black flake8 autoflake\n\nUSER user\n\n# Include CUDA binaries in PATH\nENV PATH=/opt/conda/bin:/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH\n\n# Create local conda environment\nRUN conda init --all \\\n\t&amp;&amp; conda create --name user --clone base\nRUN echo \"conda activate user\" &gt;&gt; /home/user/.bashrc\n\nWORKDIR /home/user\n\nCMD \"bash\"\n\nExtra Note\nIdeally, your docker non-root user should match your Windows user's UID and GID in order to preserve file permissions. However, if you use VSCode's .devcontainer.json to launch the container, they will run the UID and GID matching script for you (it might take a while though).\n","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tech/make-conda-great-less-suckish-again/","title":"Make Conda Great (Less Suckish) Again"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tech/microsoft-windows-productivity-hacks-and-tricks/":{"body":"Shortcut Hacks\n\nSaving PulseSecure Password in Microsoft Windows\n\nWSL Hacks\n\nSSH into a WSL2 Host Remotely\n\n\n","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tech/microsoft-windows-productivity-hacks-and-tricks/","title":"Microsoft Windows Productivity Hacks And Tricks"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tech/personal-notes-on-consumer-electronics/":{"body":"Dell XPS 17 and WD19TB Electrical Whine\nI have both the Dell XPS 17 9700 and WD19TB and they both have a very noticeable electrical whine / charging noise when plugged into AC power.

I forgot the exact context but the error contains something like:\nOMP: System error #13: Permission denied \"OMP: Error #178\"\nOMP: Error #178: Function Can't open SHM2 failed\n\nAfter struggling for hours searching on both Google and Baidu, I looked into the source code (by searching for Can't open SHM2 inside OMP's repo) and realized that it was caused by shared memory (shm) permission issues. After changing the docker run argument --ipc=host tp --shm-size=1g (erm, which was recommended by NVIDIA here), the issue was resolved. I have quoted the paragrpah below, apparently this option is not compulsory:\n\nBy default, Docker containers are allotted 64MB of shared memory. This can be insufficient, particularly when using all 8 GPUs. To increase the shared memory limit to a specified size, for example 1GB, include the --shm-size=1g flag in your docker run command.\nAlternatively, you can specify the --ipc=host flag to re-use the host’s shared memory space inside the container. Though this latter approach has security implications as any data in shared memory buffers could be visible to other containers.\n\n","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tech/wsl2-nvidia-docker-error/","title":"WSL2 NVIDIA Docker Error"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tinkering/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tinkering/","title":"Tinkering"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tinkering/project-inspirations/":{"body":"https://www.instructables.com/Localino-Open-Source-Indoor-Location-System-Arduin/\n","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/tinkering/project-inspirations/","title":"Project Inspirations"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/university/":{"body":"","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/university/","title":"university"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/university/analog-electronics/":{"body":"I am not interested in AE but this looks cool\nhttps://lnkd.in/eczBUqft\n","description":"","id":"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/university/analog-electronics/","title":"Analog Electronics"},"https://obsidian-zola.trwbox.com/docs/university/fyp-plan-trying-to-break-things/":{"body":"Methodology\nCurrently, stage 1 StyleGAN is trained using the CheXpert dataset.
